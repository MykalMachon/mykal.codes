### Static Site Generator: [Astro](https://astro.build)

Astro is my favourite way to build content sites. There, I said it! (it was never a secret).

- Blog content is all markdown in `website/src/content/posts/`
- Web Analytics are homegrown with [a simple go webapp](https://turnstile.mykal.codes/).

### Hosting: [Railway](https://Railway.app)

Railway just builds and ships the dang thing with node! very simple. 

I *was* hosting with Netlify but I hit their free usage limit and railway has usage based billing from zero to whatever you use.
