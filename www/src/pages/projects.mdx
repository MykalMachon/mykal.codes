# Projects

The projects that I'm currently working on.

<AboutNavigation />

I tend to have a lot of side projects on the go.
They include websites, web applications, command line utilities, _attempts_ at writing, and a growing variety of other things.

Most of my software related projects are [on GitHub](https://github.com/MykalMachon), but I wanted to keep a more narrative list here on the site as well.

## Websites

#### [mykal.codes](https://mykal.codes/)

The site you're on right now! this is my main personal website. It has a bunch of info about, well, me! I post personal and tech updates here, and keep a [/uses](https://mykal.codes/uses) and [/about-me](https://mykal.codes/about-me) page up to date.

#### [tinybox.dev](https://tinybox.dev)

My freelancing business, Tinybox Software! I build custom applications, infrastructure, and software solutions for everyday companies. I've built custom data pipelines, backup software, marketing sites, Shopify stores, and a whole cornucopia of miscellaneous projects over the years.
