Flipnote Hatena is a now-defunct social media platform based on sharing digital "Flipnotes" drawn in the DS and 3DS site called "[Flipnote Studio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipnote_Studio)" released on both the DS and 3DS. Here's an example:

I used this app pretty heavily; as a kid interested in art, animation, and video games who just happened to own a DS, this was a very fun overlap of interests. I created a bunch of little animations and drawings based on events in my life. The most notable in my memory is a small animation depicting me in the passenger seat while my uncle was pulled over for speeding; I remember thinking this was hilarious as a kid. I also viewed the "popular flipnotes" in the app almost daily, I remember there being lots of [stick fights](https://www.sudomemo.net/watch/CBEEA0_0A95B9C620081_000), [music videos](https://archive.sudomemo.net/watch/mg3io13c0czbyyvl24kwn2udpnac) with animated characters, [spooky loops](https://flipnot.es/5UL8E13), and other weird miscellaneous animations:

last night, I brought this up with a friend who also remembered the site and we talked about it a bit.

This morning she sent over [a site that archived all of the original flipnotes on the app](https://archive.sudomemo.net/).  
Up until today, I had assumed that most of these flipnotes were lost to the sands of time and bitrot. In reviewing the popular flipnotes.

## Quality and relevancy today

I was, for some reason, surprised at how undeniably cringe so many of these flipnotes were (see [example](https://flipnot.es/MY2918D)), but given I was using the app in middle school, which was smack-dab in the middle of my "awkward phase" that checks out. Despite the cringe, there's still lots of very high-quality animation to be found.

It's also surprising how so much of the content on there _feels a lot like what exists on TikTok today._ People could remix popular flipnotes by slightly editing the animation, or reusing the sound to make their own animations. "Music Videos" aka "MV" were also very popular, and feel a lot like fan cams or dance videos you'd find on TikTok today.

## Efforts to keep Flipnote alive

After spending some time reading through [the archive's history page](https://archive.sudomemo.net/history/) I found a link to a seemingly semi-active forum where people still make flipnotes to this day!
