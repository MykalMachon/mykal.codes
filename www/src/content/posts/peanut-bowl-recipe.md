This is one of my favourite comfort food meals. It's heavily inspired by a [HelloFresh](https://hellofresh.ca/) box we got ~2 years ago, but I've made some improvements since then. Commonly served after a hard day at work or when fighting off the cold; spice tends to clear out my sinuses.

- üßë‚Äç‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüë© Typically serves 2 people
- ‚è≤Ô∏è Takes around 25-30 minutes to prepare

_I don't have exact measurements for a lot of things so you'll have to do some experimenting; I've been sort of keen to the "put sh\*t in a pot" method of cooking lately._

By the way, if you want a free HelloFresh box [we've accumulated a bunch of free boxes for friends, take one!](https://www.hellofresh.ca/pages/resolution?c=FIH-QA1IJKXJDZQH&utm_campaign=clipboard&utm_couponvalue=170&utm_invitername=Mykal&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=raf-share&discount_comm_id=1d7ed056-9e72-42f5-a0e0-d5dd12d17fc3)

## Recipe

Rough steps; feel free to add your own twists and turns in as we go

### Preparation

Before starting with anything else I find it useful to cut things up

- Cut up the onion and bell peppers and put them aside.
  - cut diced or into strips depending on preference.
- Roughly chop the chili pepper up and put it aside.
- Roughly chop a few cloves of garlic and put them aside.
- Mince or finely chop the fresh ginger.
- Take out a pot for boiling the pasta.
- Take out a large non-stick pan for veggies and protein.
- Take out a small bowl for the peanut sauce (only if you don't have store bought).

### Cooking noodles

The noodles will likely take the longest time so I start that before anything else

- add ~6-10 cups of water to the pot depending on the amount of noodles being made.
- salt the water in the pot to your preference.
- bring the pot to a boil.
- add the noodles to the pan and set a timer for the suggested cook time of your noodles.
- halfway through, add your edamame beans to the pasta water.
- When the timer is done, strain pasta and edamame and set aside.

### Preparing peanut sauce (optional)

_If you have store bought peanut sauce ignore this step._

- in a small bowl whisk together:
  - peanut butter (1/4 cup)
  - soy sauce (1/4 cup)
  - sesame oil (1 teaspoon)
  - chilli oil (1 teaspoon)
  - rice vinegar (1 tablespoon)
  - ginger (2 teaspoons or more)
  - garlic cloves (minced from before)
  - pasta water (1/4 cup: adds starch!)
- Once it's well incorporated, set aside.

### Preparing protein & veggies

While your pasta is cooking, you can get stated with the protein and veggies.

- put your pan on the stove and set it to medium high heat.
- add olive oil and wait until the pan is hot.
- when hot, add your preferred protein to the pan and break it up into small pieces.
- cook protein until it looks close to complete (5-6 minutes).
- Add peppers, onion, garlic, and chilli pepper to the pan.
  - you can add a lil' soy sauce / water at this point if it's sticking.
- Cook and stir often until the veggies seem tender-crisp (2-3 minutes).

### Putting it all together

Once all your components are done, you can mix everything in the large non-stick pan.

- bring the pan down to medium heat.
- incorporate the noodles and the edamame into the pan.
- incorporate the peanut sauce into the pan.
- Add salt, pepper, chili pepper, and other seasonings to taste.
- Toss to coat the noodles evenly.
- Taste test and adjust accordingly.

### Serving

Split things out into 2 bowls and add the following toppings:

- Peanuts.
- Sesame seeds.
- Sriracha (optional, but personally preferred).
- Cilantro (optional, personally _not_ preferred).

Enjoy üå∂Ô∏è
