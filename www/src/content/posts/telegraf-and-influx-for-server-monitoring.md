I've been looking into how to be more pro-active about monitoring [my HomeLab](http://mykal.codes/uses#-servers--hardware) lately. With that in mind, I went on a bit of a monitoring dive and setup some basic tools on my raspberry pi's. I wanted to keep track of what I did, so why not write it up in a blog post.

More specifically, this post will give you a quick overview of how I got up and running with InfluxDB and Telegraf for monitoring my servers.

## Why InfluxDB and Telegraf?

I've already used [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) (a dashboarding tool) at work and like how it works; I also know that [Grafana is commonly used for system monitoring](https://grafana.com/grafana/) so I started my search there. After some Googling, I kept seeing a few other tools used alongside Grafana:

- [InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/): a database for efficiently storing and accessing time series data (perfect for sensors, system data, etc.). Grafana has a first party integration with InfluxDB as well.
- [Telegraf](https://www.influxdata.com/time-series-platform/telegraf/): a server agent that allows you to collect sensor info from your servers and send it back to InfluxDB and other time-series databases like [Prometheus.](https://prometheus.io/)

Sweet! I have a few tools to start experimenting with.

## Installing InfluxDB

The logical first step was to install InfluxDB somewhere so my servers could write back to it. InfluxDB has a docker image that you can use and since I have an Unraid server that's already running around 20 docker images, I threw it on there.

I was pleasantly surprised by how easy setting up InfluxDB was!

1. Followed the setup guide in the web interface and setup an admin user (should be at http://your-servers-ip:8016/).
2. Created a buckets for each pi to write to (basically a database).
3. Created a telegraf config for each pi and note the API key, and configuration files (telegraf.conf) InfluxDB provided.

From there, InfluxDB seemed to suggest I could setup Telegraf on my pis.

## Installing Telegraf

Now that I had some configurations, I went and did some reading on [how to configure telegraf](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/cloud/write-data/no-code/use-telegraf/manual-config/) on the docs site. I logged in to both my pi's, and used the commands below:

```bash
# install telegraf
sudo apt install telegraf -y

# paste in the INFLUXDB_KEY provided by InfluxDB
# at the bottom of the file.
# this will automatically define the variable for
# the user you're logged in as on login.
vim ~/.bashrc

# paste in the telegraf.conf file provided by InfluxDB
vim /etc/telegraf/telegraf.conf

# start the telegraf service, and enable it
sudo systemctl start telegraf
sudo systemctl enable telegraf

# make sure that the telegraf service has connected to
# InfluxDB successfully.
sudo systemctl status telegraf

# the output of the above command should
# NOT include any 401 errors. if it does,
# you may need to paste the API key into
# your telegraf.conf file manually
```

Once I got that done I knew that telegraf _should_ be writing back to my InfluxDB database every 10 seconds.

## Seeing server data in InfluxDB

To confirm that InfluxDB was actually getting that data, I logged back into the InfluxDB web app and clicked the "dashboards" link on the sidebar.
Thankfully, InfluxDB comes with a default "Systems" dashboard that you can use for reviewing your data, I hopped in there and saw that data was getting into InfluxDB, sweet 🎉

## Next steps

There's a whole lot more I can do to expand the monitoring capabilities, here are some ideas:

1. **📊 Grafana dashboards:** I brought Grafana up at the beginning of the post, but I haven't actually implemented it yet. Their dashboards are awesome and it would be a good next step.
2. **⏰ Usage alerting:** InfluxDB (and Grafana actually) lets you create alerts on specific criteria. For example, if your server goes over 80% usage, or goes down, you can get a slack message.
3. **📚 Keep learning:** There's a whole job around monitoring and reliability of services, so logically there's a whole lot you can learn in the field.

Thanks for reading!
