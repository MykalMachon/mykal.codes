I spent this past weekend at a cabin on an island. It was great.
I wrote around 2000 words about this cabin on an island, and how it gave me some much needed perspective on life.

I'm not going to share what I wrote though; it was a bit too personal. I'm just going to post some phone photos (forgot the real camera at home, whoops!) of views around said cabin instead.

_Let this post act as a quick reminder to:_

- Treasure your people: They're probably pretty great.
- Spend time away from screens: Computers are cool but not all the time.
- Recharge your batteries: Do things that make you happy.
- Take time to reflect: Sometimes just writing out how you feel helps.
