I found out that you could get any Shopify product as JSON/XML way too late in my Shopify development game. If there is a public URL for the Shopify product, and the store is using the standard Shopify theme engine, you can grab all the public details as JSON at any time with a quick URL trick.

All you have to do is add `.json` to the end of the product URL, and it will return the JSON file representation of the object; for XML just add the `.xml` to the end.

## Getting product info in Javascript

Here's a quick demo of how you'd grab a product's info as JSON in Javascript. All you're going to need is the URL where you can find the product, and some way of running javascript (browser, or node.js with `node-fetch`).

Let's use a product from the Allbirds store:

```js
// product url
const productUrl =
  "https://www.allbirds.com/products/mens-tree-flyers-blizzard";

// function to grab the data and return a promise
const getProductData = async (productUrl) => {
  const productUrlJSON = `${productUrl}.json`;
  const response = await fetch(productUrlJSON);
  const data = await response.json();
  return data;
};

// get the data and then log it, or do whatever!
getProductData(productUrl).then((data) => {
  console.log(data);
});
```

This should log something like this to your console:

```json
{
    {
    "product": {
        "id": 6673825890384,
        "title": "Men's Tree Flyers - Blizzard (Blizzard Sole)",

            "variant_ids": []
        }
    }
}
}
```

From here, you can do whatever you need with that data, including:

- custom CTAs/cards for the product.
- custom landing pages for the product on marketing sites.
- simple external product inventories via the sitemap.
- lots of other things...

Speaking of, if you've used this API for other weird things, feel free to comment down below with examples. I would love to see what elese people are using these for.
