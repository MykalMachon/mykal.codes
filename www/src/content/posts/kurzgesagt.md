[This is one of my favourite YouTube channels](https://www.youtube.com/@kurzgesagt). They really capture the _wonder_ of learning in a way I find really rare. Their videos always bring on a sense of nostalgic learning for me. I remember being a kid and reading books about robotics or space in my Oma's basement and just being _stoked_ about the future.

Their videos on [space sciences](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUJYP8tnRE&t=361s) and [future-earth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W93XyXHI8Nw&) are always favorites of mine. As a reluctant pessimist, I've always appreciated their realistic optimism; they find ways to highlight how we as humans _can_ band together [to solve problems like climate change](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxgMdjyw8uw), not all hope is lost, _yet_.

They also just released [a video on how they finance their business](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1x-i9z617z4) and their goals which lead me to their shop, and left me with an urge to buy a few of their posters for my office. I always appreciate when businesses are open about their process like this.

Check them out!
