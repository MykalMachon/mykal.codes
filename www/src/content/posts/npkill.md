I just deleted 8gb of old `node_modules` folders for inactive projects! 

Just run `npx npkill` in your terminal, and `npkill` will scan your hard drive for all your `node_modules` folders, display the last time they were accessed, and let you delete them.  

side note, `npx` is great for running node applications in a one-off context; Underappreciated NPM feature in my opinion.
