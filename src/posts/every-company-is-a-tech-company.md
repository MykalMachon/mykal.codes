As someone who's worked in freelance on and off for years, I've heard quite a few people drop the phrase "we're not a tech company".  

This is usually hauled out in a pessimistic tone after they're pitched on a new website, a business process that can be automated, an application that could be brought in to save time, or some work to modernize an again piece of tech they've already bought into.  

Every. single. time. I hear this I can't help but cringe. **_Almost every company is a tech company._** Do your users have phones, computers, tablets? do they have an apple watch? then you're a tech company. 

## What is a "tech company" anyways?

Is it a company that makes software? I would argue, no. In my brain, a tech company is a company where you use technology (by definition, essentially tools) to do something easier or better as a service.

Do you use QuickBooks to manager your companies' books? that's tech, you'd probably be better off having someone on staff who's sort of techy. 

* modern consumers are on the internet. that's just how it is. go where the people are
* modern consumers use social media, you should probably value it and be good at it.
* in most businesses, your tech should get out of your way. It should be making more time for you to do the work that you really love / keeps your business going. 

## What I'm not saying

I'm not saying your local coffee shop should have a technical team on staff to write their own point of sale, website, and delivery system. What I am saying is that that coffee shop would probably be better off with a generally tech-educated person who knows when to reach for tech to simplify solutions.

 Think about how many awesome restaurants you've been to where the POS system is always broken, or where their website is 5 years out of date, or where no one knows about them because they're still marketing on billboards. 

I think if we all thought of tech as a tool (you know, what it is) instead of a big scary risk a lot of businesses, and therefore people, would be better for it.
