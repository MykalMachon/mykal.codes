I was talking with a friend yesterday about how I learned web dev.

They're just starting out in University, and were surprised to hear that I don't really attribute a lot of my technical knowledge to university classes. 

With them in mind, I made them a quick list of the most notable web development resources I used to learn.

> ‚Ñπ I'm still working on this one- it'll be updated over time.
>
> I may re-organize things to be more focused on the level of complexity than the format as it probably makes more sense for quick referencing.

## Video Courses üì∫

This is honestly where I've learned most of what I know in a "traditional" sense.

* [Wes Bos's Learn Node](https://learnnode.com): Comprehensive course that goes over what Node is, how it works, HTML templating, basic JS bundling, etc.
* [Wes Bos's Advanced React & GraphQL](https://advancedreact.com/): If you have some basic React knowledge, this tutorial takes it to the next level with Next.js, GraphQL, and friends!
* [Level Up Tutorials](https://leveluptutorials.com): React, Svelte, etc: All of Scott's content on Level Up Tuts is great!
* [Free Code Camp](https://freecodecamp.org): lots of really great courses (mostly on their YouTube channel) and even certificate programs!

## Podcasts üé§

I listen to podcasts to keep up on what's new & upcoming in web dev, as well as a way to nerd out about existing tech I haven't used:

* [Shop Talk Show](https://shoptalkshow.com/): Just! build! WEBSITES! Dave Rupert and Chris Coyier talk about web dev stuff from a down-to-earth perspective.
* [Syntax FM](https://syntax.fm): A relatively beginner oriented podcast hosted by Scott Tolinski, and Wes Bos.
* [JS Party](https://changelog.com/jsparty): Talking about Javascript and the web with a "party" of rotating hosts.
* [Remotely Interesting](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/09/01/announcing-a-remotely-interesting-podcast/): The Netlify devrel team's podcast, they're typically talking about JAMStack and a number of other webdevy things. 

## Projects üë©üèª‚Äçüíª

This is where most of my practical knowledge came from- and where I recommend people spend most of their time!

* [Supastack](https://github.com/MykalMachon/Supastack): A mix between SubStack + Tumblr. It's definitely not complete but gave me time to learn SupaBase & Postgres.
* [Smolcart.js](https://github.com/TinyboxSoftware/Smolcart.js): A semi-finished library used for adding Shopify products to cart via Javascript
* [Mykal.codes](https://github.com/MykalMachon/Mykal.Codes): This website! a blog- it's been rebuilt 4-5 times in different frameworks (Next.js, Gatsby, 11ty, now Astro)

## Books üìö

I use books more as a reference, than anything.

* [Flask Web Development](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/flask-web-development/9781491991725/): I recently read this to learn about flask for work- it's great! Walks you through creating a modern-ish web app with Flask.
* [Humble Bundle Books](https://www.humblebundle.com/books): Humble bundle usually puts together some sort of developer book bundle. I've got around 60 books from publishers like O'Reilly through their bundles at _amazing_ prices.
* [Increment Magazine](https://increment.com): A _very_ high quality magazine about software development. Lots of varied, and well done articles from different disciplines of software (edit: rest in peace)

## Miscellaneous ‚ú®

Other stuff I use on a regular basis

* [Mozilla Developer Network](https://mdn.org): have you ever wanted docs for like every web API ever? this is it!
