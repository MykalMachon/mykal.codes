# About Me

Here's a quick summary of who I am.

<AboutSlider />

## Professional

Professionally, I write software. mostly web, besides that, I'm not sure- still figuring it out.
I have a weird laundry list of technical skills including "modern" web, Shopify theme, and backend dev. I've also
been picking up some enterprise software skills [at UFV](/posts/new-job-at-ufv/).

I like learning and solving technical problems, and just sort of follow whatever road that leads me down! _It's worked so far!_
I also run a small software consulting co, so if you have a problem you want to solve, [check it out!](https://tinybox.dev)

## Personal

I like spending time with friends, and family (including my 2 cats), and doing generally nerdy things including:

- 🎮 Playing Video Games
- 📚 Reading Sci-Fi, Horror, [and more](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/141327631-mykal-machon)
- 👩🏻‍💻 Building fun side projects (webapps, writing, etc.)
- 🍻 Spending time with family and friends
- ☕ Making coffee

## Education

I graduated from the University of the Fraser Valley (UFV) with a Bachelor in Computer Information Systems in December of 2021.

[UFV's BCIS degree](https://www.ufv.ca/computing/) is essentially a mix of a traditional Computer Science Degree,
with a number of other technical fields (Networking, IT, and Project Management) with a focus on projects and
practical work experience.

I also did a bit of AI research work while I was a student at UFV.
