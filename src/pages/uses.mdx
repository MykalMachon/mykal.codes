# Uses

A living document of the gear and tech I use day-to-day.

## ü§î What's Up With Uses?

It's a convenient way to list the gear you have, keep track of what you're using, and make it shareable with others, all in one place.

Check out everybody elses "/uses" page on [uses.tech](https://uses.tech/) as well

## üìö Desk Setup

This is where the large majority of my day-to-day gear lives.

* **Desk**: old door strapped to some generic sit/stand legs.
* **Keyboards**:
  * [Ducky One 2 SF](https://www.duckychannel.com.tw/en/Ducky-One2-SF): 65% wired board with Cherry MX browns, RGB + a few artisan caps. Lives on my desk at home.
  * [Nuphy Air60](https://nuphy.com/products/air60) + [NuFolio](https://nuphy.com/collections/accessories/products/nufolio-v2-for-air60): a 60% wireless board, Gateron low-profile browns with a fancy carrying case. I use this on the go and at the office.
* **Mouse**: Logitech G502 gaming mouse
* **Monitors**: some older Dell monitors I got for free from my last job. I'm not sure what the model is but they're 1080p and good enough!
* **Google Home Display**: I use the display to show photos, and as a convenient way to use my smart home controls.

### üñ• Desktop Computer

* **CPU**: Intel I7 10700K @ 3.8GHz.
* **CPU Cooler**: Corsair H60i AIO.
* **RAM**: 32 GB (4 x 8GB) Corsair Vengeance RAM @ 3600MHz.
* **GPU**: GTX 1660 Ti.
* **SSD**: 256 GB ADATA SATA III.
* **HDD**: 2TB Hard Drive (not sure of brand).
* **PSU**: Corsair CX750F RGB 750 watt.
* **Case**: Corsair iCUE 5000X RGB Mid-Tower ATX.

### üíª Laptops

I somehow ended up with a stack of laptops over time.

* **2 x Dell Latitude 7440**: One from the current job, one from the previous job that I got to keep. They're both i7's, with 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage.

## üíΩ Software

I use a whole bunch of software on the day-to-day, here's a summary of specifically the dev tools I use: 

* **Operating system:** Windows 10/11 with WSL 2 (Ubuntu LTS).
* **Terminal:** [Windows Terminal](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/windows-terminal/9N0DX20HK701?hl=en-ca&gl=CA) + a custom ubuntu profile.
* **Shell:** [oh my zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) + the [PowerLevel10k theme](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k).
* **Version control:** git + [GitHub](https://github.com/MykalMachon) but exploring self-hosted options like [Gitea](https://gitea.io/en-us/)
* **Diagraming:** [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/) for finished diagrams + [excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) for whiteboarding
* **Code editor:** [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for personal _or_ [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) by JetBrains for work at UFV.
* **Database viewer:** [TablePlus](https://tableplus.com/) for personal, or [DataGrip](https://www.jetbrains.com/datagrip/) by JetBrains for work at UFV.
* **Data manipulation:** [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) or Excel if there's no other option.
* **Notes:** [Trilium notes](https://github.com/zadam/trilium), which is basically [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) but setup as a self-hosted web app.

I'm sure there's more, but as of writing this is what I use daily to get my job done. 

## üíø Servers & Hardware

I have an ever-growing homelab in my office as well. The lab has a few servers, but not much else.

### üê¢ NAS Server (a.k.a MoonTurtle)

My NAS is used for data storage and a bunch of dockerized applications (like NextCloud, Trillium notes, some dev environments, and databases). It's mostly just a Frankenstein of my first PC build from 2012. The specs are:

* **CPU**: Intel I7 3770 @ 3.2GHz.
* **CPU Cooler**: Stock Intel cooler.
* **RAM**: 16GB of Kingston HyperX @ 1600MHz.
* **GPU**: Intel Integrated Graphics.
* **SSD**: 256 GB Samsung EVO Black: used as a cache drive.
* **HDD**: 2 x 4TB Seagate IronWolf NAS drives: one parity drive, total 4TB of storage.
* **PSU**: XFX 500 watt.
* **UPS**: APC 850VA Battery Backup (backs up the router, switch, and NAS).
* **Operating system**: [unraid](https://unraid.net/) makes managing VMs, Docker Images, and VPN access to my house really easy.

### üçì Raspberry Pi Cluster

I have 3 Raspberry Pi 4Bs w/ 8gb of RAM I use for a Micro K8s cluster. They're all setup with the exact same hardware:

* **Storage**: 64GB SD card
* **Case**: [Argon One](https://www.argon40.com/en-ca/products/argon-one-v2-case-for-raspberry-pi-4) case for Raspberry Pi.

## ü§òüèª Misc

* **Sony WH-1000xm4**: Awesome wireless noise-cancelling headphones. I have the black ones üéß
* **Lots of books**: I have a huge stack of unread books on my desk that I'm slowly working through.
* **Forestry.io:** a CMS that I use for this site. I've just recently set it up, and the text you're reading right now is the first content change I'm making in the CMS.
