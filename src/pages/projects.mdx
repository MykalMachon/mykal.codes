# Projects

I tend to have a lot of side projects on the go.
They include websites, web applications, command line utilities, _attempts_ at writing, and a growing variety of other things.

Most of my software related projects are [on GitHub](https://github.com/MykalMachon), but I wanted to keep a more narrative list here on the site as well.

## Websites

#### [mykal.codes](https://mykal.codes/)

The site you're on right now! this is my main personal website. It has a bunch of info about, well, me! I post personal and tech updates here, and keep a [/uses](https://mykal.codes/uses) and [/about-me](https://mykal.codes/about-me) page up to date.

#### [mykal.coffee](https://mykal.coffee)

A coffee blog! This is a relatively new project that I started to centralize all of my coffee knowledge. Coffee has been a new-ish hobby of mine, and I have a few recipes, and software tools that are on the site.

#### [tinybox.dev](https://tinybox.dev)

My freelancing business, Tinybox Software! I build custom applications, infrastructure, and software solutions for everyday companies. I've built custom data pipelines, backup software, marketing sites, Shopify stores, and a whole cornucopia of miscellaneous projects over the years.

## Software

#### [QuickCrypt](https://github.com/MykalMachon/QuickCrypt)

A simple command-line tool for securely storing API keys, passwords, and other secrets. I made this because I wanted a place to quickly stash passwords in a linux CLI.

#### [FormStore](https://github.com/MykalMachon/FormStore)

A JavaScript module that saves local copies of form state to [IndexedDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API). I originally created this as a solution for one my freelance clients; They had large forms on their site that were often completed by users on cheap mobile phones with spotty connections. FormStore made it easy to recover from a crashed browser, or a failed `POST` request.

#### [Caesar](https://github.com/MykalMachon/Caesar)

A template for a dockerized flask web application that supports asynchronous task workflows via Redis. This was abstracted out from one of my Tinybox projects where I built a flask web application where business users could generate, then download/email reports.

#### [Snakes on a browser](https://github.com/MykalMachon/snakes-on-a-browser)

A simple proof-of-concept of Python running in a Preact application via WASM. This was something I put together in an hour or two when I first heard about WASM. if you've never worked with WASM check it out, I think you'd be surprised by how easy it can be to get up and running.
