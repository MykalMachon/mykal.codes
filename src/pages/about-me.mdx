# About me

Here's a quick summary of who I am.

## Professional

I've been programming on and off since I learned about [scripting in GameMaker 8](https://manual.yoyogames.com/The_Asset_Editors/Scripts.htm) as a middle-schooler in 2013. I'm openly addicted to learning and tend to get bored in roles where I'm not challenged. I've also been really interested in "practical" applications of

These traits have led me to a few rewarding jobs so far. I've worked in general IT, web development, and now work as a Systems Analyst at UFV. For more specifics on my job history, you can [check out my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mykalmachon/)!

I've dabbled in a bunch of languages, tools, and services but I'm most up-to-date with the following:

<Details summary="üñãÔ∏è Languages and runtimes">
* **HTML / CSS / JS**: good old web primitives.
* **Typescript**: can't get much better than JS with types.
* **Node.js**: for web servers, job runners, desktop apps, scripts, etc.
* **Python**: I love the simplicity and beauty of Python code. It's just so fun to write.
* **Go**: I'm still a gopher-in-training but have loved what I've seen of so far; Especially the performance.
</Details>

<Details summary="üî® Tools and libraries">
* **React & Next.js**: my favourite way to build fullstack applications.
* **Flask**: the most flexible way to write web stuff with Python.
* **Docker**: makes deps management, development, and deploys trivial.
* **Prisma**: my go-to ORM for node.js-based projects.
* **SQLAlchemy**: my go-to ORM for python-based projects.
</Details>

<Details summary="‚òÅÔ∏è Hosting and DevOps">
* **Railway**: for hosting full-fat applications, and databases in the cloud.
* **GitHub**: the defacto hosted version control and CI/CD pipeline.
* **Netlify**: for hosting static websites and web apps in the cloud.
* **Azure**: I have my AZ-900 and am working on my AZ-204 cert currently.

## Education

I graduated from the University of the Fraser Valley (UFV) with a Bachelor in Computer Information Systems in December of 2021.

[UFV's BCIS degree](https://www.ufv.ca/computing/) is essentially a mix of a traditional Computer Science Degree,
with a number of other technical fields (Networking, IT, and Project Management) with a focus on projects and
practical work experience.

I also did some AI research as a research assistant while studying at UFV. My research was centred around analyzing the [Teams Corpus](https://sites.google.com/site/teamentrainmentstudy/corpus?authuser=0) to predict group outcomes and building web-based corpora review and annotation software with React, Next.js, and Python via WASM.
