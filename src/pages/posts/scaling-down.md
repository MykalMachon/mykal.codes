In May of 2019, during the first few months of the Coronavirus pandemic I made the decision to start an e-commerce / web development freelancing business, Tinybox Software Development.

This was the first time I'd ever been fully self employed. I had a tPonne of fun, launched a bunch of sites, and learned *a lot* along the way.

### Why Scale Down Then?

1. **Growth:** I want to keep learning and growing technically, and without challenging, weird problems for me to solve I've been feeling stagnant.
2. **Stability:** It's extremely hard to get approved to rent an appartment without a boss someone can call. Freelancing can pay great, but it's hard to prove stability unless you've been doing it for awhile.
3. **Burnout & Stress:** This is heavily related to No. 1, and 2 on the list above. That said, Juggling work is hard; On average I was working on 3 projects at the same time, and felt like the pace I was working at wasn't sustainable. 

### Is This the End?
**No! I still plan to work on freelance projects, just at a much smaller scale.**

I genuinely enjoy doing the work when it's not something I'm working on 25/8- so I'll likely keep doing it.
