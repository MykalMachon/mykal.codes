  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>
    I'm Mykal! I'm currently working as a Systems Analyst II at <a
      href="https://ufv.ca/">the University of the Fraser Valley</a
    >. I also do freelance software development work through my company <a
      href="https://tinybox.dev/">Tinybox Software</a
    >. If you want to know more about my career, you can check out my <a
      href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mykalmachon/">Linkedin</a

  </p>
  <p>
    I also contribute to, and release my own open-source software <a
      href="https://github.com/MykalMachon">on GitHub</a
    >
  </p>

  <h2>Technical interests</h2>
  <p>
    I've been programming on and off since I learned about scripting in
    GameMaker 8 as a middle-schooler in 2013. I'm openly addicted to learning
    and tend to get bored in roles where I'm not challenged.
  </p>

  <p>
    These traits have led me to a few rewarding jobs so far. I've worked in
    general IT, web development, and now work as a Systems Analyst II (team
    lead) at UFV.I've dabbled in a bunch of languages, tools, and services but
    I'm most up-to-date with the following:
