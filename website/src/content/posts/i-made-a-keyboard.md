I built out a Corne v2 keyboard using a kit from [typeractive.xyz](https://typeractive.xyz).&#x20;

They made the whole process really easy to work with and it was actually pretty easy to setup and get working on. I was expecting it to be rought relearning how to type but to be honest it has not been too bad so far.
