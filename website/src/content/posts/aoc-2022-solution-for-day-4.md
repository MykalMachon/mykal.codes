[Advent of code challenge #4](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/4) is done and dealt with!

These last two challenges have been the first time I've used any sort of discrete math since university. Given all the discrete logic I've crammed into my brain from school, distilling these problems down to simple set math has made them quite a bit easier to work through. 

Here's my solution for part 1 and part 2 of day 4's challenge:

```python
"""
https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/4

steps for part 1 of today's challenge:
1. break input down into lines ("pairs of elves")
2. look at each pair and create ranges based on assignments
3. use sets to find if either set is a subset of the other 
4.1 if either of the sets are subsets, return True, else False.
1. return the sum of sets that are subsets of their pair.

steps for part 2 of today's challenge:
1. use steps 1-2 of the above
2. use sets to find if the two elements are disjoint.
2.1 if the sets are disjoint, there is no overlap, there is if they are
3. return the sum of sets with any intersect across pairs.

I'm still a day behind on challenges. I'm hoping to get caught up and complete challenge no. 5 tonight.
