[Advent of Code challenge #5](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/5) is all done, and I'm officially caught up! 

The "hard-part" of this challenge for me was the just making the data usable. The actual task of moving the things around based on steps was pretty quick to implement. These are my-least favorite kind of advent of code challenges because it feels a bit like [artificial difficulty in video games](https://videogaming.fandom.com/wiki/Artificial_Difficulty). 

The functionality that "solved" the challenge was 31 loc, but the ingest functionality took 33 loc. Half the work was just getting the information I needed into a usable data structure. _why not just provide things in a useable format from the jump?_ Maybe I'm missing the point and the ingest is supposed to be a fun part of the challenge and just doesn't vibe with me. 

/rant.

Anyways, here’s my solution for part 1 and part 2 of day 5’s challenge:

```python
"""
https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/5

steps for part 1 of today's challenge:
1. load in the cargo stacks as input
2. load in the steps that you need to take on input
3. follow the steps in step 2 on the stacks
4. grab the top items from each stack

    """loads the cargo stacks from the input.txt file"""
    with open('input.txt', mode='r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
        lines = [line.strip('\n') for line in file.readlines()]

        # get number of stacks in the cargo
        last_line = lines[len(lines)-1].replace(' ', '')
        num_stacks = range(int(last_line[len(last_line)-1]))

        # create cargo stacks
        stacks = [[] for stack in num_stacks]
        for line in lines[:-1]:
            curr_pos = 0
            for idx, stack in enumerate(num_stacks):
                curr_char = line[curr_pos:curr_pos+3]
                curr_pos += 4
                if curr_char.replace(' ', '') != "":
                    stacks[idx].append(curr_char)
