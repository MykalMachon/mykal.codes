I just read [this article](https://time.com/7295195/ai-chatgpt-google-learning-school/) and the linked [MIT study](https://www.media.mit.edu/publications/your-brain-on-chatgpt/) (TLDR: people "using AI consistently underperformed at neural, linguistic, and behavioral levels" in testing) over my lunch break. It confirmed a thought I've been having quite often lately; we should probably think of AI a lot like we think of candy. *A nice sweet treat every once in a while, but not something that should make up the majority of your diet.*&#x20;

I think this approach is especially important for those of us who's work can easily be augmented or in some cases replaced by existing AI tools: Software Developers, Systems Analysts, Writers, Academics, etc.&#x20;

## An example of my candy addiction

The first time I really thought about this was around 6 months ago when I setup a new computer that didn't have copilot on it yet. I noticed that I was typing a few characters then, without thinking about it, waiting for code completions. I hadn't even thought about how I was going to implement the function past the first line because I had wired my brain to expect an AI to take a first pass. I turned off copilot's inline code completions then and have had them off 95% of the time since then.

That said, I still use Copilot quite a bit but when I do it's very intentional.&#x20;

&#x20;

Brains are meant to think. If we don't use them, I don't see why we *wouldn't* see some form of atrophy.&#x20;
