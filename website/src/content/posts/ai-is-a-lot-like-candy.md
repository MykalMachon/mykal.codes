I just read [this article](https://time.com/7295195/ai-chatgpt-google-learning-school/) and the linked [MIT study](https://www.media.mit.edu/publications/your-brain-on-chatgpt/) (TLDR: people "using AI consistently [underperformed](https://www.media.mit.edu/publications/your-brain-on-chatgpt/) at neural, linguistic, and behavioral levels" in testing) over my lunch break and realized that people, should probably think of AI a lot like we think of candy. A nice sweet treat every once in a while, but not something that should make up the majority of your diet.&#x20;

I think this is especially true for those of us who's work can easily be augmented or in some cases replaced by existing AI tools: Software Developers, Systems Analysts, Writers, Academics, etc, etc.&#x20;

Brains are meant to work, and if we don't use them I don't see why they wouldn't attrophy like any other muscle.&#x20;
