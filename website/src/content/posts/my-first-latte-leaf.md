It's not perfect, but I think I'm finally starting to get the latte art game down.

I had built some bad habits early on that made it very hard for me to get any art down. Here are some adjustments I made in the last month that got me from white blob to leafy-heart-thing:&#x20;

1. Get an automated milk steam wand. I don't know if my old steam wand was just bunk, but I could not get consistent milk out of it.
2. Pour onto your espresso on a 40 degree angle. *Pouring onto a flat shot does not work*. This was a huge one for me.
3. Start by slowly pouring 3-4 inches up from the cup at until you've used 1/3 to 1/2 of your milk. If you pour lower or faster you'll get a "white-out" (big white blob). &#x20;
4. When you want to pour your art, bring it down to around half an inch above the middle of your cup and start pouring a bit faster while moving side to side. &#x20;

I am no expert, so take this with a grain of salt as it's what's been working for me.&#x20;
