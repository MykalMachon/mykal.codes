Hey! does this work?

It looks like it should? I wonder how other markdown features are supported

# This is a heading 1

## This is a heading 2

### This is a heading 3

#### This is a heading 4

This is some text below heading four. I am also going to put a picture of a cute little cat below this ding dang thing and make it so cute wow.&#x20;

![big ol picture of a cat man](@assets/posts/test-post/file.png)

## Coding test below

Here's what code will look like on this page

```js
const helloworld = "hey, it's me!"
const goodbyeworld = "hey, I'm leaving"

const start = () => {
  console.log(helloworld);
  console.log(goodbyeworld);
}

start(); // letssgoooo
```

this is some text below the code that I want to edit.

## This is a list of content that I can write&#x20;

1. item one
2. item two
3. item three

## This is a table&#x20;

| Column 1  | Column 2        | Column 3        |
| --------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| some data | some other data | what about here |
| and here  | here is good    | yah!            |

## This is another thing I guess
