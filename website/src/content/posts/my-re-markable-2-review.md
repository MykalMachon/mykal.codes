I got a reMarkable 2 as a gift from my team at work after coming back from my paternity leave this year and have been using it for the past few months daily for note taking, sketching, and reading. If you haven't heard of a reMarkable before, [check out their product page for a quick summary](https://remarkable.com/store/remarkable-2).

I'm a sucker for the whole "digitial minimalism" thing and I've been trying to get off the "social internet" as much as possibe lately, especially so since having a kid. With that in mind, this device was always something that interested me.&#x20;

## The good

* Writing on the reMarkable feels like a *better* version of writing on paper in my opinion. It feels extremely satisfying to use.&#x20;
* The build quality is fantastic. The device feels almost weirdly light for how solid it is; I also really appreciate the rubber feet on the bottom to keep it in place while writing. &#x20;
* The battery lasts for literal weeks: I've only charged the device twice in the almost 3 weeks of daily use.&#x20;
* I love reading on the Remarkable; because it's a bigger e-ink display you can very easily read full-sized PDFs which is awesome. EPUB is cool but reading on a smaller screen means diagrams and code usually gets squished or formatted weird; not a problem here.

## The close-to-good

* The cloud sync features feel half finished and are slow&#x20;
* The OCR or "Convert handwriting to text" feature is extremely unreliable
* The chome extension to send articles to your remarkable, while a great idea, was not very well executed. It strips all the images out of articles and makes code snippets unreadable in my experience. I wish this was *just a little better.* As a developer I know how easy this would probably be to fix and it drives me nuts.

## The bad

* The subscription cost to host my \< 10mb of notes being $5 USD per month is insane. I sync 50gb of Obsidian data for $7 USD a month. Do better, especially considering the service feels half baked and slow to use.
* The actual "text" note taking experience feels like it was slapped together by an intern during a hackathon. You're only offered 2-3 formatting options "big sans serif header", "medium header", "normal text", and "bullet". Come on, really? I know that this was probably done in the spirit of "minimalism" but seriously? This has been a solved problem for EVER. Just add more formatting options.
* Selecting and editing text on the device is nearly impossible. It's SO HARD to select or highlight bits of text when you're in text editor mode.
* To be honest, I'd rather they just completely remove the text editor mode and do OCR on the letters and let me search there, which brings me to my next point.
* OCR text is not searchable! WTF! this is a digital note taking device that wants you to take handwritten notes, WHY CAN I NOT SEARCH SAID NOTES? I know, I know, just convert them to the text notesâ€¦ and lose all the nuance and benefit of handwritten notes? nice!
* I didn't think I would miss having a backlight. I was wrong. I do. Especially now that I have a little kid, reading in a dark room before bed is important and breaking out the book isn't a great experience.&#x20;
