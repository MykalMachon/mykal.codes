## This is a post from keystatic!

I'm writing this post from the keystatic CMS website that I think I'm going to use to manage, edit, and publish all the content for this site from moving forward.

Honestly, the authoring experience on here is pretty freaking solid if I'm being honest. It makes editing everything super easy and it just feels like I'm using a really well done word editing application that can tie directly into my website.

It can even do code blocks from what I can tell which is even better.&#x20;

```javascript
const cms = 'keystatic';
const ssg = 'astro';

console.log(`I'm using ${cms} and ${astro} to build my website!`);
```

everything looks great from within the editor, now the real test is to see how well this gets published out to the site.&#x20;

What does it do for images? - okay images don't work for now. bummer! we can probably fix that though.&#x20;
