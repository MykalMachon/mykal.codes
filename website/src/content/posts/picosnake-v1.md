Video games are largely why I got into computers as a kid and pursued a career in software development. One of the first "technical" things I ever really learned how to do on a computer was [how to use GameMaker 8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij9v1OF5VRY) via old school youtube tutorials.  

That said, I pretty much write ETL jobs, integrations, and web services at work these days. While that's all a farcry (ðŸ˜‰) from game development, my want to make games never really went away. I've dabbled in gamedev over the years and recently I've been messing around with [PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php) and threw together this little snake clone. 

## What is PICO-8?

Their site says it better than I probably could!

> PICO-8 is a fantasy console for making, sharing and playing tiny games and other computer programs. It feels like a regular console, but runs on Windows / Mac / Linux. When you turn it on, the machine greets you with a commandline, a suite of cartridge creation tools, and an online cartridge browser called SPLORE.

I'd recommend checking the site out if you're interested. You can play a bunch of games other's have made on the site and there's a bunch more information.

I'll probably write a bit more about PICO-8 and why I find it so engaging but to sum it up I think it comes down to constraints. You get such a paired-down environment to work in that you learn lots and have to keep your scope small at first.
