I've noticed I'm spending more and more time with only a terminal open lately, with that, I've found quite a few handy little CLI apps, utilities, and even a shell.&#x20;

## What my setup looks like

I use [zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) as my primary shell with [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) and a [powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k/tree/master) theme with the [Meslo NerdFont](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k/blob/master/font.md) to add all the fancy icons and ligatures into my command line. Admittedly, I don't do a whole lot with zsh that you couldn't do with bash, I just prefer the plugin ecosystem and themes available there over baseline bash.&#x20;

## Some tools I've been using

* EXA: like ls but better&#x20;
* LazyGit: a nice terminal UI (TUI) for doing complex actions in git and viewing git history&#x20;
* Superfile: a visual representation of your file system and it's details. I still use good ole cd/ls/etc. but this is nice for viewing file details like edit time and size easily without remembering infrequently used commands.&#x20;
