[I started as a Systems Analyst I at UFV on May 10th, 2021](/garden/posts/starting-at-ufv) and am stoked to be moving on up into a Systems Analyst II role as of May 17th, 2023.

## What I've been up to

Honestly, it's hard to believe that it's been 2 years since I started at UFV. I've grown a lot in the role. I can't talk too much about what I've been up to but I can give a brief summary of the _type_ of things I'm working on.

I've had a real taste of legacy-enterprise-land. I'm happy to say I've had the opportunity to modernize quite a few dinosaurs, document a lot of undocumented systems, automate a lot of complexity away, and help our team pick up some DevOps, testing, and cloud chops. I've also written a _lot_ of Docker-powered Python apps and worked extensively in React & Typescript apps in Javascript land. Hopefully, all that work has made our students, staff, and faculty's lives better bit by bit.

## What this promotion means

The biggest difference between a Systems Analyst I â†’ Systems Analyst II (SA II) role on paper is that SA II is more of a leadership position on the team. I'll be working across the team more and enabling others while working on larger impact and more complex projects.

That said, I'm excited to take on more responsibility, get more say in how we move forward, and continue to drive our team deeper into sustainable software and systems development practices.

## Thanks, everyone

There are so many people that I could not have gotten here without. You all know who you are (my wife, friends, coworkers, family, and mentors) and I've thanked you all individually so I won't put you on blast in public ðŸ˜‰

If the next 2 years are anything like the previous 2, I'm sure it will take me lots of places I never would have expected.
